My thoughts on compiling c++ programs on Eclipse is that it takes a while to compile compared to Codeblocks and Visual Studio Code. I am debating on what should I use for my class whether Eclipse/XCode or run a Virtual Machine on windows and install Visual Studio which is much user friendly.

I am in my adjustment phase coming from a Linux environment to Mac/OSX, and I notice is that mac is awesome in terms of development workflow however there are a couple of times where I miss Linux fast pace development workflow, I am still figuring out how to increase my workflow on OSX.

Therefore I conclude that there is not much a big difference between OSX and Linux in terms of the development workflow. Mac is the equivalent of tesla, elegant and awesome. Linux is the equivalent of Honda, proven and tested and awesome.

Choosing between the two OS's is just a developer/engineer preference, there is not much a difference. But you can't develop iOS apps on Linux, you need a mac to develop apps for it, I think that's just it.

Just my own opinion and not trying to argue. At the end of the day, whatever os you use doesn't affect your productivity and creativity. Feel free to get in touch with me.
