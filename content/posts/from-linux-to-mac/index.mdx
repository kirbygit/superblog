I finally got my new macbook pro 13" for school.And I love it so far , this is my first macbook I ever owned.Will be using this mainly for school.

It has been two days since the macbook arrived, so far I am loving it.I was able to setup my dev environment pretty quickly from generating a new ssh key,installing IDE's,installing homebrew,iterm2,rvm & different ruby versions.Will research more about what to tweak and enhance for my workflow.
